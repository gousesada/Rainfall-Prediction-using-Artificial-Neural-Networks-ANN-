# Rainfall-Prediction-using-Artificial-Neural-Networks-ANN-
This project uses machine learning to predict rainfall by analyzing weather data. 
By applying an Artificial Neural Network (ANN), the model learns from historical weather patterns like temperature, humidity, and wind speed to forecast future rainfall.
The project involves cleaning and preparing data, building the ANN model, and evaluating its accuracy through various performance metrics. 
The ultimate goal is to improve weather forecasting using deep learning techniques.
